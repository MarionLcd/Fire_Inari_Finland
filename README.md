# Fire_Inari_Finland
Here, the regional fire histories reconstructed in northern Finland along a latitude/elevation gradient. 
The study was conducted in the vicinity of Lake Inari, in northern Finland.  Fire reconstructions were done using macrocharcoal records from 8 lakes sampled in 4 different environments. Lakes Skaida and Purnu are in high latitude/elevation environments characterized by birch woodlands. Lakes Ahven and Muotka are representative of mid-high latitude/elevation transitional environments characterized by mixed pine-birch forests. Lakes Rosalia and Inka are located in mid latitude-low elevation pine forests. Lakes Charly and Pikku are representative of low latitude-mid elevation mixed coniferous (pine and spruce) forests. 

In these folders: 
(1)	Dates of fire events identified for each lake using CharAnalysis software (https://github.com/phiguera/CharAnalysis). 
(2)	Regional (Reg) and local (each site) fire histories for the past seven to ten millennia: 
   - fire frequency (FF) 
   - biomass burned (BB)  
   - fire size index (FS)  
   
Ages were expressed in cal.yr.BP.
