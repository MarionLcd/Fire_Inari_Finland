# Fire_Inari_Finland
Here we present the regional fire history reconstructed in northern Finland along a latitude/elevation gradient. The study was conducted in the vicinity of Lake Inari, in northern Finland (between 68°N and 70°N and 25°E and 29°E). Fire reconstructions were done using macrocharcoal records from 8 lakes sampled in 4 different environments. Lakes Skaida and Purnu are in high latitude/elevation environments characterized by birch (Betula pubescens) woodlands. Lakes Ahven and Muotka are representative of mid-high latitude/elevation transitional environments characterized by mixed pine (Pinus sylvestris)-birch forests. Lakes Rosalia and Inka are located in mid latitude-low elevation pine forests. Lakes Charly and Pikku are representative of low latitude-mid elevation mixed coniferous (pine and spruce [Picea abies]) forests.

In these folders:

(1) Regional (Reg) and local (each site) fire histories for the past seven to ten millennia:
•	fire frequency (FF)
•	biomass burned (BB)
•	fire size index (FS)

(2) Dates of fire events identified for each lake using the CharAnalysis software (https://github.com/phiguera/CharAnalysis).

Ages were expressed in cal. yr BP.
